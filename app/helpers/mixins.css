/*
  From canon cms, some nice mixins to help you write less css, including:
    - media queries (both mobile & max-width first)
    - typography (font sizes using style.yml, also available as utility classes)
    - accessibly hiding text; useful to add context for screen readers
    - layout (set a parent `position` to `relative`, then give the child a mixin like `absolute-expand` or `absolute-center`
    - resets (list-reset, button-reset)

  Note: many of these are also available as utility classes:
